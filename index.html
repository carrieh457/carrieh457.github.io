			<p> Hi friends! My name is Carrie and this is me. I'm ethnically Chinese, but grew up in a small suburban town in New Jersey, went to high school in rural Pennsylvania, and am currently exploring the lakes of Ithaca, New York. If you would like to know about my experiences and work, go straight ahead to my resume and portfolio, but if you would like to know more about me feel free to read on.
				
     		<p>I love to create. I love to explore. I love to “let my life speak”. </p>
				
			<p>I’m the type of person who would rather spend an hour putting together a handmade card for someone, create my own DIY decorations and organizers, and hoard what others might call trash to create something I like to call art. Whether it be painting, drawing, design, photography, jewelry making, or ceramics, I love it all and I self-taught myself most of the skills I know. There is so much that can be done with art and it is this type of freedom that allows me to explore the different possibilities.
			</p>

			<p>Speaking of exploring, I also thoroughly enjoy exploring the world and what it holds. I haven’t had the chance to travel to many countries, but I take advantage of every opportunity I’m given. These opportunities include taking four years to uncover the unfamiliar town of my high school, going on a service trip to my parent’s home country, China, and now slowly unfolding the deep lakes and gorges of Ithaca. Often times I take the same routes over and over when I go on my adventures, but each time I’m greeted with something new, whether it be a change in weather, mood, or the people I encounter. It’s this type of freshness that I look forward to in each day and what motivates me to learn more about the world around me. </p>
				
     		<p> “Let your life speak”, is an old Quaker saying that I was constantly told throughout high school. It didn’t mean much at first, but when I came to understand it and saw how it slowly became relevant in my own life, I began living by this old saying. I wish to create and explore the world because these are things that I love to do, but more importantly I wish to do what I love to serve the greater community and work towards the issues that I care about, like environmental, educational, and human rights issues. Whether it be traveling to a foreign country and physically working to rebuild a school or creating art for social change from home, I hope to to live truthfully and follow my beliefs. </p>
